Policy</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>The very first price analysis performed by CorrectPrices.com will offer a potential increase in profits exceeding the entire year's subscription cost,
	therefore after the results of the initial analysis are provided to the subscriber, no refunds will be provided during the first year of service due to the
	exceptional financial benefits already provided to the user. For the same reason, after the first pricing error analysis report has been generated from your CorrectPrices.com account, you owe an entire one year subscription cost, minus any amount already paid, to Correct Prices, regardless of whether the account is canceled before the end of the first year. Exceptions will only be made in the event that the website stops functioning for the user and
	CorrectPrices.com support personnel cannot correct the issue.  In such a case, or after the first year, refunds will be provided on a prorated basis.</i></b></p>
